## LIB topic range basis
^78dea1

Asking good questions and choosing the right goals creates a good foundation for the future

The topic selection needs to conform to the basic norms of the community, and a LIB with a larger audience may develop better

### Recommended target range

- Optional career planning route, such as rolling, lying, running, etc.

- Special key point directional choices such as major choice, employment or further education, etc.

- Learning paths for specific subjects or knowledge such as computing and economics learning paths

- Practical solutions or methods in personal development such as how to manage energy, avoid depression, and access information efficiently

- Other content with value and room for development, such as some interesting ideas and valuable questions


## Quick initialization and perfect path
^538646

Similar to the whole process that I went through after making the decision and after:
1. Initial decision-making information collection
2. Execute, gain new experience
3. New reflection after overall progress
4. Summary and Review
5. (if repeatable) refine the overall route to find the optimal

Usually the process is quite lengthy, however notice that in fact the same paths and feelings have been repeated many times in the world. Experience itself is also a relatively slow and passive acquisition of information, so when enough information is collected, a concept of the entire process can be quickly established and a more correct choice can be made. This is also the value of the LIB approach and the waynext idea.

### Normal route
1. Basic planning and sorting out the clues
2. Query a lot of information
3. Filter useful information and integrate or stack
4. Plan again, hoping to notice the information that exists in theory and find basic use cases
5. Supplementary information to complete the structure, reference guide
6. Complementary use cases and environments
7. Enter the LIB development process (more people will become better)

**Give a specific example** Build a lib related to studying abroad
1. Organize the entire process of going abroad, understand the possible options, and the overall process in general. Collection of major information sites, etc.
2. Gather information in detail around each part of the process, such as study abroad, work, development, visa issues, etc.
3. Organize the collected information and problems in various processes into the initial lib
4. After sorting out the appropriate internal structure, you can initially release it for more comments
5. Further query information or execution or feedback from other channels
6. Supplementary Use Cases (Portraits of Applicable Persons) and Contexts
7. Further development



## Ideal LIB
^fc5f4e

structural science
The method conforms to the general procedure (it is also possible to obtain it without the general procedure, but it needs to be obtained by the general method)
Sufficient information collection and effective statistical level
Lots of use cases and testing More usage and engagement

When the above conditions are met and tend to be stable, it is ideal


ideal lib value
Information coverage can be completed efficiently
cut costs
Easier to further improve

Defects of ideal lib
not easy to achieve




## New tools & new ideas

Gradually introducing more valuable and helpful new ideas and new tools is of great significance to the development of LIB

#### Both sides
- Pay attention to the emergence of new ideas, new technologies and new tools
- Try practicality in LIB and get feedback, evolve gradually

#### E.g:
- The idea of ​​bidirectional links to build associations from text
- What is a well-rounded project Facilitates out-of-the-box, proper project logic structure
- Gamification - state balance management to make information and solutions more executable
- other useful additions



## Keep updating

Update in daily use, and constantly organize ideas

Can write better collaboration guides, find collaborators, and stay engaged with other participants

Cooperate with other activities of waynext, such as local activities, online invitations and other activities to find new inspiration



## Simple start

Don't get too hung up on it, start right away with information gathering and stacking. Better to think and collect often after you start

Try and repeat. You can also practice more

Collect core ideas, you can try to migrate from other places or fields






## Collect the problems encountered during the writing process

At present, the infrastructure in all aspects is not good enough. Welcome to ask more questions and seek solutions together~
