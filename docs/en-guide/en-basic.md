# Basic guide

This LIB hopes to receive appropriate information as a guide for waynext users and contributors. The current guide is mainly aimed at the preparatory community.

Mainly include the following parts

- The basic goal and implementation logic of waynext
- Basic definition of LIB
- Beginner's Guide
- Contributor Guidelines
- Current community status and LIB construction plan
- Table of contents



## Basic goals and implementation logic

waynext.library hopes to collect effective decision support information to form several solutions and gradually optimize through tests and problems brought by more users to form some valuable LIBs (information bases). Covers the main path directions and brings efficient information support to users.

## Basic definition of LIB



### Fundamental contents

- Goal A LIB should have a goal to answer a question, describe a one-hop path, achieve a goal, etc.
- Background The existing information and dependencies should be sorted out
- Main body of content The main text that meets the basic requirements of the community, built on the goal
- Practice & Test Realized examples as practical tests. should be gradually enriched



### Several ideas that help improve the quality of LIB

Higher coverage A higher percentage of information that can already be collected

Appropriate structure Appropriate logical structure. Easy to read and easy to collaborate at the same time

Direction and planning The future development direction of LIB, which can include issues, goals, progress estimates, etc., which can help collaboration

Testing and Feedback Test these in practice and get feedback to update them gradually



### Format and Form

LIB is currently implemented using the GitHub repository. Text is the main content, more appropriate citations are suggested

The file is recommended to use markdown for simplicity and ease of editing

As the main content entry, readme.md should contain an introduction to the overall content

Recommended: Edit the project with the obsidian editor, you can use features such as bidirectional links



# Beginner's Guide

### Usage: Quick Start

1. Open a LIB you are interested in and read the readme
2. Feedback can be made through issue
**Critical thinking** As much as possible, integrate and think as much as possible, and gradually understand with practice
**Give feedback and suggestions** Giving opinions will be very helpful for the iteration of LIB, and it will also make your thinking clearer
**Try more** You can only get enough information if you keep trying



### Participation: Collaborate through PR or issue and other contact methods

**issue**: Similar to lib-related Q&A, it can solve some simple problems
**PR (pull request)**: Creating your own patch and inviting the original lib owner to incorporate your own optimizations is the most effective way to collaborate
**Other participation and contact methods:** Add new information or questions to LIB, find participants, and promote the lib to more people through the community, email, or even offline, etc.


# Contributor Guidelines

Lifecycle of LIBs

- Create Create a LIB
- Test and iterate use and update
- Mature with good coverage and information inclusion
- Changes New problems or new states are created to bring about changes

Improvements are fine, take it easy. Concepts, designs, skeletons, etc. are all acceptable, as long as they can grow gradually

Be open to new content and invite others to be more tolerant of new issues and ideas can lead to progress while inviting others to collaborate with you


See [Contributor Guide](./Contributor Guide.md)



## Preparatory period

At present, LIB is in the preparatory period. During the preparatory period, it supports exploration and attempts in more directions. At the same time, it is noted that the content may be very imperfect.

The format or completion requirements are very low, and the potential and development applicability are more important.

As long as there is a suitable self-justifying structure and a framework that fits the spirit of the community

#BasicGuide status and planning

### Several LIBs currently in preparation
- Basic guide
- How to transcode
- Run related
- Study route and curriculum plan
- Civil servants
- worldview
- some good lib ideas [[some good lib ideas]]
- ++

### Basic Guidelines Status
Focus on the preliminary creation and complete the most basic guide framework
Currently need to optimize as much as possible in early multiplayer initial LIB cooperation

### Basic Guide Planning
1. **The main direction of short-term planning** Integrate and sort out the information of the main path
2. **Future value direction** Hope to produce a more efficient form, hope to achieve
3. **Perfect and interpret the waynext concept itself** can do better background supplements like Open Source Guide (https://oschina.gitee.io/opensource-guide/)
