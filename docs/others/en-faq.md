### Changes are unpredictable, is future planning feasible?

Just like the unpredictability of the market, although the future is difficult to predict and basically impossible, in fact, even the minimum preparation can shield and smooth many risks. If you can go further, you will have the opportunity to plan and try more accurately, and even find opportunities that truly belong to the times and follow the trend. Considering that young people do not have a lot of basic information, and time has a great advantage, the importance and value of planning issues are extremely high at this time.

### Why are existing models not good enough?

It is true that the modern Internet has brought a far greater amount of information than before. From pictures to posts to videos, there is a lot of information about future plans. However, they are very fragmented and often lack system and timeliness, and are often shallow due to space constraints. This causes great difficulties for users, especially when they do not know how to query effectively, they will get a lot of repetitive and low-quality information, which makes it difficult to support selection. If you can collect more questions, make a more unified route plan, after more people use and feedback, you can maintain decentralization and effectiveness, etc., and do better.

### What value does the decision bring?

The pain and difficulty of choosing the wrong major is impressive, even at the smallest. For us in the current world of changes, the value of decision-making cannot be overstated. Modern society is no longer the closed and low-speed form of the past. Only by mastering more information and making appropriate decisions can we have the opportunity to achieve the expected goals. At the same time, wrong decisions have infinite costs, but they may be avoided with only a small amount of ex ante information. This is the value of directional decisions.

### What is the point of sharing and communicating, and why would anyone share?

Sharing and communication have too many meanings. From a utilitarian point of view, sharing can enable oneself and others to examine their own history and planning, seek more experience, and combine more viewpoints, which can be very beneficial to the realization of their own goals. From the perspective of value, sharing and communication can also help others to do better and enhance the value of their own past experiences. For young people, although competition is the norm, cooperation is fundamental, especially cooperation in information and knowledge, which can be 1+1>2.

### Does the community welcome other voices or opinions?

waynext welcomes other voices or comments. Real knowledge comes from practice, and only by fully considering various situations and absorbing various voices can information be more valuable and decisions can be more in line with expectations. No matter where the direction is, no matter what the situation is, as long as it can meet the basic spirit and requirements of the community - rationality, freedom, science & engineering, and can have potential value, then the community welcomes it.
